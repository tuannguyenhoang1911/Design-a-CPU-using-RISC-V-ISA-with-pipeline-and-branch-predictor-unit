# Design-a-CPU-using-RISC-V-ISA-with-pipeline-and-branch-predictor-unit

In this design, we use pipeline technique with the CPU that supports basic RISC-V ISA. Our basic CPUâ€™s architecture has enough fundamental blocks to ensure that it can work and execute simple instructions. Besides, using branch predictor unit is effective for the CPU to solve many problems when processing many branch instructions with pipeline technique.
